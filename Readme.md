<h1>Whatsapp-spam</h1>
<p>I made this program to send messages runnig in loop to a target contact on my whatsapp account</p>
<p>i used puppeteer to launch the chromium browser then open <a href="https://web.whatsapp.com/">whatsapp web</a> then query the DOM to select the target contact</p>
<p>Then query the dom to select the input field and puppeteer to type a content then hit enter which run on a for loop</p>
<ul>
<li>ðŸ˜‚This is a whatsapp-spam that run on puppeteer</li>
</ul>
